# Live-Pentesting-Targets
Time spent: 7 hours spent in total
> Objective: Identify vulnerabilites in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red

The six possible exploits are:

* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each color is vulnerable to only 2 of the 6 possible exploits. First discover which color has the specific vulnerability, then write a short description of how to exploit it, and finally demonstrate it using screenshots compiled into a GIF.

## 1.) User Enumeration
 ![UsernameEnum-1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52509352/83204438-ac3d6c80-a100-11ea-8816-badea9aff39b.gif)

![UsernameEnum-2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52509352/83204447-b2cbe400-a100-11ea-9509-d01d2329fea7.gif)

![UsernameEnum-3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52509352/83204453-b95a5b80-a100-11ea-84c0-caa3e39942da.gif)

* This Vulnerability was found on the GREEN website
* The indication for the wrong information changes if the user exists.
* Used Inspect Element to see when the HTML chaned, when the user exists the HTML code send "failure" when the user does not exist the HTML code sends "failed"
## 2.) IDOR
![URL-IDOR](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52509352/83204407-9def5080-a100-11ea-8780-4aa0df621ce9.gif

* This Vulnerability was found on the RED website
* The user can access hidden users by doing URL Manipulation
* The last shown id number is 9 but if you change it in the URL to 10 or 11 we can see two hidden users

## 3.)SQLi
![SQLi](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52509352/83204389-962fac00-a100-11ea-9ae1-972e35e7b500.gif)

* This Vulnerability was found on the BLUE website
* SQL code can be used in the URL in order to get a random user out of the data base 
* The SQL code I used was:
* 'OR 1=1'

## 4.)XSS
![XSS](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52509352/83204464-c0816980-a100-11ea-8f8d-8dd2d44aa718.gif)

* This Vulnerability was found on the GREEN website
* An attacker can inject XSS attacks into the feedback forms 
* Script used
* <script>alert('I hope this works');</script>

## 5.)CSRF
![CSRF](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52509352/83206562-07259280-a106-11ea-82fa-dc18045d9a36.gif)

* This Vulnerability was found on the RED website
* Sent a fake email to the database, that if someone clicked on would run a hidden HTML script

## 6.)Session Hijacking
![SessionHijacking-1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52509352/83205275-f9bad900-a102-11ea-8920-30dccf86fcb8.gif)

![SessionHijacking-2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52509352/83205345-2bcc3b00-a103-11ea-834b-57bb977d3cf8.gif)

* This Vulnerability was found on the BLUE website
* Used the script given to us to put into the victim's session 
* Then used burp to capture my own session, then used the victim's session id to gain access to the site
